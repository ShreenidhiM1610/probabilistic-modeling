Probabilistic Modeling and Verification of a Service Process using DTMC and MDP in PRISM

This project focuses on modeling and verifying a service request-response system using Discrete-Time Markov Chains (DTMC) and Markov Decision Processes (MDP) in PRISM Model Checker. The system models user requests and service responses probabilistically and generates:

âœ… PRISM Model â€“ Defines the DTMC/MDP-based service behavior.
âœ… Sequence Diagram â€“ Visual representation of state transitions using PlantUML.
âœ… MDP Representation â€“ Converts the probabilistic process into an MDP model.

Key Features:
Implements DTMC and MDP models for a service-based process.

Uses PRISM for probabilistic verification and path generation.

Converts PRISM traces into sequence diagrams using PlantUML.

Provides Java-based automation for model conversion.

Technologies Used:
ðŸ”¹ PRISM Model Checker
ðŸ”¹ Java (for trace processing)
ðŸ”¹ PlantUML (for sequence diagrams)
ðŸ”¹ GitHub (for version control)

Use Cases:
ðŸ”¹ Probabilistic verification of service workflows
ðŸ”¹ Performance analysis of request-response systems
ðŸ”¹ Visualization of Markov-based service processes
